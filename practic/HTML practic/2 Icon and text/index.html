        The <strong>Moon</strong>  is Earth's only natural satellite, circling the planet at an average distance of roughly 385,000 kilometers (239,000 miles).
        With a diameter of just under 3,500 kilometers (about 2,160 miles), the cratered surface of the rocky object is one of the most recognisable objects in the sky.
        A single orbit of our planet takes the <strong>Moon</strong>  27.3 Earth days - the same amount of time it takes for the satellite to also rotate once on its axis.
